![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.1.0-blue.svg?style=for-the-badge)

An immortal personal microblogging system that...
- supports tumblr features like `reblog`, `follow`, `queued posting` and an infinite-scroll `dashboard` feed
- runs in the cloud using 100% free (but industry-grade) components, so:
  - it costs you nothing to run your blog 24/7 forever 
  - you don't even need a computer to set it up or run it
- can never be killed, because you own and control:
  - your blog
  - your blog's content 
  - your blog's social network
- is open-source, so you may customize it to your heart's content
- can run on any platform you like, so you are never locked into one service
- is *free* as in *free*dom

## Quickstart instructions (time needed: 5 minutes)

1. Click [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

2. Make a new Heroku account if you don't have one yet (it's free). Sign in.

3. Enter a name for your app. This name will become your blog's address. E.g., if you enter `scampy`, your blog's address will be `scampy.herokuapp.com`. Click `Deploy app`.

4. Go to [dashboard.heroku.com](https://dashboard.heroku.com) and select your app.

5. Click the `Resources` tab at the top.

6. In the `Add-ons` search bar, type `mlab` and select `mLab MongoDB`. This database stores your blog's content. Select the `Sandbox - Free` plan and click `Provision`.

7. Visit `your-app.herokuapp.com` in a browser (where `your-app` is the name you entered in Step 3). 

8. If all went well, you'll see a welcome message that says "Congratulations! Your secret campfire blog is alive!" Follow the instructions there to set your password and secure your blog. 

*If you're not the DIY type and prefer to have all this done for you, email getscampy@secretcampfire.com and someone on our team will take care of you. We'll install up to 10 blogs for a one-time fee of $5. After they're set up, your blogs belong 100% to you and run free forever.*

## Prologue

Once upon a time, most websites on the Internet were owned by the people. Humble individuals. Mom, pop, brother and sister. You and me. But that time is long gone. Today, most websites and publishing platforms lie in the fat claws of a few big corporations. 

When someone else controls your data, they have power over you. They can hold you hostage, control what you say and strangle your voice anytime what you say does not agree with their business agenda. And so today, more than ever, our freedom is in danger.

That's why `secret campfire` was created on January 2019 to replace tumblr. Because as you've already noticed, there just aren't any good options out there. And we're tired of rolling the dice and investing in yet another *flavor-of-the-month* platform... only to have them betray us or crap out later.  

With `secret campfire`, you can finally set up your forever home online. It belongs to you and you alone. No one can tell you what you can or can't do with it. And no one can shut you down. 

Enjoy the 'fire and share the love: http://secretcampfire.com
